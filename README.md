# Mandeep_Java_Assignment_4
my forth assignment for Java

I worked on the following topics-
- track wins/losses in a seperate file (you will need to read/write to a file) making sure to include the # of wins and losses!
- provide a way to view the battle history (win/loss record) basically a print statement 😏
